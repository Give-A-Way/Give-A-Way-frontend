### üìù Summary
Rising prices on food and other necessities due to inflation have left underrepresented low-income people of color unable to buy food for their families. Supply chains for food distribution faced disruptions due to COVID-19 and increased consumer demand for food drastically. This raised food prices across the globe ‚Äì increasing the severity of food insecurity among the already 811 million people struggling to make ends meet ( [USGLC,](https://www.usglc.org/coronavirus/global-hunger/#:~:text=Supply%20chain%20disruptions%20due%20to,to%20bed%20hungry%20every%20night) ‚ÄúCovid-19 Brief: Impact on Food Security.‚Äù). These high prices persist today in today‚Äôs current economics. The people impacted the most by this are people of color.

Historically places of worship have been pillars of food and hygiene distribution programs in New York City. Places of worship have relied on food donations from food manufacturers, businesses, and individuals to supplement their food inventory. It is unfortunate that these forms of distribution lack a platform for collaborating with each other on the distribution of food. 

___



### üòû The Problem 
There is an excess amount of food waste by NYC businesses every day that could be donated and help decrease food insecurity for people of color in the five boroughs. However, the current processes of food donation to food distribution centers, like places of worship, are not centered or streamlined and fail to bring all parties and stakeholders together to tackle food insecurity in NYC's underserved communities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
